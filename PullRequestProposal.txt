## Pull Request Title:
[Feature] Add fresco program for kitchen appliances

## Pull Request Description:

#### Overview:
This pull request introduces the `fresco` program, which is a command-line tool for communication with a theoretical kitchen appliance MCU using a named pipe.

#### Changes Made:
- Added `main.c` file.
- Added Fresco executable
- Implemented support for handling little-endian encoded binary frames.
- Added parsing logic for data points (dp) with various types.
- Implemented basic error handling and data point ID bounds.

#### Motivation:
The goal is to create a tool capable of running as a Linux daemon, listening for messages from the MCU, and printing them in a pretty format. This will facilitate communication with kitchen appliances through a standardized protocol.

#### Testing:
- Manually tested the program with sample messages and verified correct parsing.

#### Dependencies:
- Uses standard C libraries.

#### Additional Notes:
- This is an initial implementation and may require additional features and error handling in the future.
- The message handling which involves int16 is not working properly.
